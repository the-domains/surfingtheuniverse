            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 28 - Quantum Experience</h1><p>Unlike classical experience which is through one or more of your five senses, quantum experience is through a non-classical "quantum" sense which can feel the effect of your quantum pasts and futures by "quantum experiencing" your "quantum now". Your body is a collection of cells and molecules - all of which can be modeled by...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a6c741cd275b6b8ca876682b52e75db7/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=200&cropwidth=200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fblank.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 26 - All of your "Now" Pasts connect to all of your "Now" Futures through the Present Moment</h1><p>I just realized this as I wrote it: All of your "Now" Pasts connect to all of your "Now" Futures through the Present Moment. At first, I only wrote the title as "All of your Pasts connect to all of your Futures." As I wondered if this were really true, and what the implications were,...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d45f1572dc57b7d48a315f228872a5bfa11c7cee.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 25 - Ever-changing Pasts and Probabilities of Pasts</h1><p>Have you ever wanted to change your past? Well you can't change the past you experienced, but that has only a tiny influence on your possible futures. What you can change are your possible pasts. Why would you want to do that you ask? Because your possible futures and their probabilities are determined by your...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It doesn't matter where (or when) the events are - they can be in the same time slice or different time slices. The connection strength between events is a measure of how likely both events would occur in a single classical universe in the same sequence order and...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f4d5342b2f414e12e5080ffb1fefdc9a3f1c23ea.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 24 - Ever-changing Futures and Possibilities</h1><p>From the viewpoint of you in a particular universe, your possible futures and their probabilities are ever-changing. In fact, from any viewpoint they are as well. So going back to the big room with all of your futures represented as selfies on the wall, if you could stop time and sit in the room "outside"...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1fec7da5bdf3410d472fd60a5175c12a5591694b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The reality we live in is more interesting than it appears. This is because we can only classically experience one universe at a time.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 21 - Is your future set? or random? or is it controllable?</h1><p>In a Newtonian universe, you have one future and it is predetermined even if you can't calculate it in practice. In theory, you could. Although given the complexity of the universe, you could argue that the universe is random. This could also be what you conclude from trying to predict the future of a quantum...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/57a3033206f0375a912bdab2e6a20c3d52c75e29.jpg"></article>]]></description>
