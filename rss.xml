            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 12 -Event Interference</h1><p>You can feel event interference when you have some future event that you have planned. There are universes where you go to or experience the event and those universes where you don't. As the time for the event approaches, you can feel the probability that you will go to or experience the event change.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a6c741cd275b6b8ca876682b52e75db7/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=200&cropwidth=200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fblank.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 9 - Event Probability Waves</h1><p>The best way for me to explain event probability waves is to notice that the last page - actually the last two pages - were written single-line spaced vs. double line spaced. The "event" in this case was when I wrote the second line of the page - did I skip a line or not....</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dac125ca709c7d748483baa47755001c94e0f9b3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 7 - Quantum Universe (or Multiverse)</h1><p>In contrast to a Classical Universe, where all objects big and small move according to Newton's laws of motion, our universe is a Quantum Universe full of interacting energy waves. Surfers spend a lot of time paddling in the ocean or sitting on their board and watching the waves as they come in.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a9175bac3f96edcd7c010d742586f83bc58be688.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 5 - Quantum Experiences</h1><p>Our mind is capable of quantum experiences. While classical experiences are those experiences that arise from our interactions with a single classical universe, quantum experiences are when we interact with multiple classical universes, which I will call the quantum universe - or the multiverse. I am not certain now which is the better name.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The waves coming in are powered in most part by the changing gravitational pull of the moon as it revolves around the earth.
