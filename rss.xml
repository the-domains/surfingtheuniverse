            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 1 - Surfing the Multiverse - Increasing your Happiness One Universe at a Time</h1><p>This is as good a title as any for what you are about to read. I am 100% certain that you will read this entire book - every word. I am as certain of this as I am that I in fact finish writing this book. How can I be so sure?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/30396c062b25ab774004643d94f210f367c53ac1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 11 - Wave Interference</h1><p>Throw two rocks into a pond and watch the ripples as they meet. You will see an interference pattern. This is a property of waves. For now, I just want you to be aware of this interference and to imagine how it may occur with event probability waves.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d6ca41fa4040810833abbb84bddc3dd433599a37.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 13 - Predicting the Future</h1><p>I just noticed that I dated the last four pages I wrote this morning incorrectly - ten days in the future. I also noticed that I'm writing single-spaced again. I can feel the influence of other universes. It was a bit unusual that I woke up early and went to the lighthouse to write.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 14 - Events are Connected</h1><p>I'm listening to a band at the Sand Bar in Capitola. I heard them playing as I was walking back to my car. My car is parked ten yards away.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 10 - Parallel Universes and Event Probabilities</h1><p>I think of my single-spaced vs. double-spaced writing in terms of parallel universes.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 12 -Event Interference</h1><p>You can feel event interference when you have some future event that you have planned. There are universes where you go to or experience the event and those universes where you don't. As the time for the event approaches, you can feel the probability that you will go to or experience the event change.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 9 - Event Probability Waves</h1><p>The best way for me to explain event probability waves is to notice that the last page - actually the last two pages - were written single-line spaced vs. double line spaced. The "event" in this case was when I wrote the second line of the page - did I skip a line or not....</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 7 - Quantum Universe (or Multiverse)</h1><p>In contrast to a Classical Universe, where all objects big and small move according to Newton's laws of motion, our universe is a Quantum Universe full of interacting energy waves.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 5 - Quantum Experiences</h1><p>Our mind is capable of quantum experiences. While classical experiences are those experiences that arise from our interactions with a single classical universe, quantum experiences are when we interact with multiple classical universes, which I will call the quantum universe - or the multiverse. I am not certain now which is the better name.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The waves coming in are powered in most part by the changing gravitational pull of the moon as it revolves around the earth.
