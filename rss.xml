            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 8 - The moon at the lighthouse</h1><p>The moon is over my right shoulder behind me as I watch the waves at the lighthouse waiting for the sunrise. The waves coming in are powered in most part by the changing gravitational pull of the moon as it revolves around the earth. We can use Newton's classical laws of motion to predict where...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a6c741cd275b6b8ca876682b52e75db7/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=200&cropwidth=200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fblank.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

My butt was hurting from the hard chair I was sitting on. This is an example of me classically experiencing the universe.

Because of the complexity of energy waves in your brain, it is extremely difficult for you to sense these with your mind.
