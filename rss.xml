            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 51 - Know your Quantum Self</h1><p>Think about the choices you have made today and over the last few days that have led to you being at the place you are right now.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 59 - Choosing Both means Choosing Classical</h1><p>You can imagine yourself being somewhere or you can physically go there. In our age of Facebook and messaging, it is tempting to think one can have shared experiences virtually. This is not a time to rely on your parallel self to have all of the classical experiences while you stay in your head.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

You can sense this and be affected, good and bad, by your continued connection with them in parallel universes.
