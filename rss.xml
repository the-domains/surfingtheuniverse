            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 36 - What question do you want to answer?</h1><p>The type of question I can help you with is of the form "Should I ...?". Questions such as "Will I ...?" or "How do I ...?" can be generally answered by "Yes you will in some universes and no you won't in others" and by "You need to use your free will and understanding...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a6c741cd275b6b8ca876682b52e75db7/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=200&cropwidth=200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fblank.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 34 - Who are you? Quantum Sensing into the Future</h1><p>I asked my uncle Kirk to read the prior 33 pages, which you have now read if you're reading in order. I'm wondering now about you ... who are you? Can I, in the present moment of writing this page, sense your thoughts in your present moment of reading this page?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dac125ca709c7d748483baa47755001c94e0f9b3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

I'm not sure why I'm having trouble, other than it's easier said than done. I think I know what I need to do different.

I was the only one getting on the bus and it was empty. Eulinda, the coach driver, greeted me with a big smile and reassured me that I was on the right bus.

I'm going to ask a slightly different question: How many drinks did I have last Sat night? 0? 1? 2? 3? 4? more?
