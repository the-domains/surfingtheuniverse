            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 16 - Unexpected Events lead to your Future</h1><p>Here is an assignment for you to demonstrate in a personal way how unexpected events are strongly connected to your possible futures. Pick something important in your life - it can be anything. Now trace backwards in time to events that lead to the fact of this important thing in your life.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a6c741cd275b6b8ca876682b52e75db7/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=200&cropwidth=200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fblank.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 21 - Is your future set? or random? or is it controllable?</h1><p>In a Newtonian universe, you have one future and it is predetermined even if you can't calculate it in practice. In theory, you could. Although given the complexity of the universe, you could argue that the universe is random. This could also be what you conclude from trying to predict the future of a quantum...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/57a3033206f0375a912bdab2e6a20c3d52c75e29.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 32 - Examples of Quantum Sensing</h1><p>You already sense parallel universes without realizing it. One of the most common ways is when you meet someone for the first time and feel like you know them somehow. This is often associated with a feeling that the two of you must have known each other in "another life".</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/781e1c8cd644a0303b692631bc921fb3b07aad4a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 33 -Imagining 3+3=6 dimensions</h1><p>We are very well suited to imagine three dimensions because our world as we sense it is a three-dimensional space. You may remember learning about Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions, where any point in 3D space is represented by a coordinate (x, y, z). Now let's imagine that instead of each point representing a point...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>
