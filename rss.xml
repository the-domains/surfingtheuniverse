Often there are other factors involved, including the free will choices others may make. Look for opportunities where you can make choices that are...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a6c741cd275b6b8ca876682b52e75db7/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=200&cropwidth=200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fblank.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

You can create possible universes by making choices - by using free will. The harder the choice, i.e. the more free will required, the more effect you have on the probabilities of the universes around you. 2015-0920Su 0840 Zilker Park Free will is the source of power used to move through...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>
