            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 31 - Is Anything Possible?</h1><p>I was asked yesterday if anything is possible. To answer this question, I considered two possible interpretations: Is anything possible in the set of classical futures which are connected to the classical now? Is anything possible in the set of quantum futures which are connected to the quantum now?</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a6c741cd275b6b8ca876682b52e75db7/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=200&cropwidth=200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fblank.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 37 - Should I Stay or Should I Go Now?</h1><p>Should I Stay or Should I Go Now? This is a question that can affect your futures. Whether you are on a first date, a last date, or thinking of one more drink, how you answer, and more importantly how you actually act, has universe opening possibilities - and universe closing possibilities.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/65678b8f9672d65f2566c3ff175d96ebd903f35a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Questions such as "Will I ...?" or "How do I ...?" can be generally answered by "Yes you will in some universes and no you won't in others" and by "You need to use your free will and understanding...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

I was the only one getting on the bus and it was empty. Eulinda, the coach driver, greeted me with a big smile and reassured me that I was on the right bus. There was a second bus ten minutes behind her which...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 40 - Brenda's French Soul Food</h1><p>Did you meditate long enough to feel the probabilities change? Or do you think of me as an alcoholic who can never say no to one more drink? Or maybe you think since I gained respect for the "one more drink" question, that I'm normally a light drinker and last night I had one too...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 38 - Should I have one more drink?</h1><p>I didn't realize it at the time, but it is obvious to me now that yesterday I quantum sensed eight hours into the future. When I wrote yesterday about "thinking of one more drink", I wasn't sure why that example popped into my head. Had I written it with a pencil, I would have erased...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 43 - How many drinks?</h1><p>We are nearing the end of our quantum sensing experiment. I'm going to ask a slightly different question: How many drinks did I have last Sat night? 0? 1? 2? 3? 4? more? Think about the answer and notice how your answer varies as you consider the question.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/507017b14a88902988dc54261945cbb5e3b2edad.jpg"></article>]]></description>
