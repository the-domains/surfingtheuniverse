            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 54 - Birth in a Multiverse</h1><p>Fifty years ago today I was born in a small town in Texas. About nine months before that I was conceived. The genetic makeup of my physical body that I know as my own was determined by one in over 100 million of my father's sperm cells in the ejaculation that led to my birth....</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a6c741cd275b6b8ca876682b52e75db7/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=200&cropwidth=200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fblank.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

Even if you don't stay in touch, you can be certain that one of your parallel selves is staying in touch.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 57 - Life in the Multiverse</h1><p>For my birthday I "planned" an unplanned day guided by the intention to not do anything that I wouldn't enjoy repeating every day for the rest of my life. My experience was different than my intention, but close to it. I'm certain that my quantum self did manage to meet this intention in a good...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 60 - Act on urges that create new universes</h1><p>When you meet someone and sense there may be a connection of whatever kind, follow up on that sense - ask to exchange contact information. Then stay in touch. Anytime you have a feeling to form a deeper connection with someone, do something that will possibly lead to that deeper connection.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 58 - Quantum Life is Many Journeys</h1><p>Last night I stayed at a friend's place in SF. As I was walking to go eat and write at Tommy's Joint, I passed the Great American Music Hall. The Human Condition were performing later and they served food there so I decided to trade writing for live music.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 56 - Death in the Multiverse</h1><p>This morning I received a happy birthday message from Carmel. Along with the birthday message she also shared that her father had died during the night. When we die in one universe do we die in all universes? No, we don't. Our classical self dies in the universe it is in.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 52 - Live Fully in the Moment</h1><p>To know your quantum self you must first know your classical self. Be aware of all of the classical sensory inputs your body experiences. Whenever you are communicating with someone - in person or otherwise - listen and observe. Pay attention to your own feelings. Trust your feelings.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>
