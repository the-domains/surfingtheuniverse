            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 17 - Drummer Girl</h1><p>The girl sitting at the table next to me just played drums for one of the songs. The bartender had just introduced her as a drummer, and the band allowed her to play. She knew the bartender because she had been at the bar last night with her family.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a6c741cd275b6b8ca876682b52e75db7/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=200&cropwidth=200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fblank.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 32 - Examples of Quantum Sensing</h1><p>You already sense parallel universes without realizing it. One of the most common ways is when you meet someone for the first time and feel like you know them somehow. This is often associated with a feeling that the two of you must have known each other in "another life".</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/781e1c8cd644a0303b692631bc921fb3b07aad4a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 33 -Imagining 3+3=6 dimensions</h1><p>We are very well suited to imagine three dimensions because our world as we sense it is a three-dimensional space. You may remember learning about Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions, where any point in 3D space is represented by a coordinate (x, y, z). Now let's imagine that instead of each point representing a point...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

I'm not sure why I'm having trouble, other than it's easier said than done. I think I know what I need to do different. One thing I realize is this will take a while -...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 34 - Who are you? Quantum Sensing into the Future</h1><p>I asked my uncle Kirk to read the prior 33 pages, which you have now read if you're reading in order. I'm wondering now about you ... who are you? Can I, in the present moment of writing this page, sense your thoughts in your present moment of reading this page?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 31 - Is Anything Possible?</h1><p>I was asked yesterday if anything is possible. To answer this question, I considered two possible interpretations: Is anything possible in the set of classical futures which are connected to the classical now? Is anything possible in the set of quantum futures which are connected to the quantum now?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Whether you are on a first date, a last date, or thinking of one more drink, how you answer, and more importantly how you actually act, has universe opening possibilities - and universe closing possibilities.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/65678b8f9672d65f2566c3ff175d96ebd903f35a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
