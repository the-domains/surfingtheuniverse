            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 40 - Brenda's French Soul Food</h1><p>Did you meditate long enough to feel the probabilities change? Or do you think of me as an alcoholic who can never say no to one more drink? Or maybe you think since I gained respect for the "one more drink" question, that I'm normally a light drinker and last night I had one too...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a6c741cd275b6b8ca876682b52e75db7/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=200&cropwidth=200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fblank.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 38 - Should I have one more drink?</h1><p>I didn't realize it at the time, but it is obvious to me now that yesterday I quantum sensed eight hours into the future. When I wrote yesterday about "thinking of one more drink", I wasn't sure why that example popped into my head. Had I written it with a pencil, I would have erased...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dac125ca709c7d748483baa47755001c94e0f9b3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Page 43 - How many drinks?</h1><p>We are nearing the end of our quantum sensing experiment. I'm going to ask a slightly different question: How many drinks did I have last Sat night? 0? 1? 2? 3? 4? more? Think about the answer and notice how your answer varies as you consider the question.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/507017b14a88902988dc54261945cbb5e3b2edad.jpg"></article>]]></description>

If you want it to be part of your experienced life in the future, repeat it more - make it a tradition! Doing so greatly increase the probability of the repeated event being experienced by you in the future.
