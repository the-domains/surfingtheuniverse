PAGE 1 -- SURFING THE MULTIVERSE -- INCREASING YOUR HAPPINESS ONE UNIVERSE AT A TIME

This is as good a title as any for what you are about to read. I am 100% certain that you will read this entire book -- every word. I am as certain of this as I am that I in fact finish writing this book. How can I be so sure? 100%? Turn the page to find out ... :)
